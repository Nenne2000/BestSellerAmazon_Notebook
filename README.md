# PROGETTO DATA SCIENCE

## AMAZON BEST SELLER 2009/2022

in this jupyter notebook carried out as a project for the datascience course for the University of Genoa i try to study the sales behavior of amazon bestsellers like a data scientist.
I found the dataset on kaggle and i don't know if the data is based on a reliable source.

The Notebook is in italian (sorry)
